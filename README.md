# Team Profile Generator
![ICS](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-ICS-orange)


## Description

- This project was created so that developers can create cards for each of their team members.
- This is a team profile generator that organizes a team. Each member has a different role(E.g. manager(s), engineer(s), and/or intern(s)).
- I built this generator because it makes it easier for team members' information to be consolidated into a single file.
- I practiced using node.js, npm install(e.g. commands such as 'npm i inquirer@8.2.4 express', installs the modules for inquirer and express), etc.  
  
  **The command** 
  ```
  npm init -y
  ```
  **is also used to create a package.json**
