## Description

What was your motivation?
- This project was created so that developers can cards for each of their team members.
- This is a team profile generator that organizes a team. Each member has a different role(A manager, engineer(s), and/or intern(s)).
- I built this generator because it makes it easier for to insert information into a single file.
- I learned how to use node.js, npm install(Specific commands such as npm init -y to install the correct modules).
  The command 
  ```
  npm init -y
  ```
  is also used to create a package.json
